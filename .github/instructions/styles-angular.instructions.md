# Project coding standards for SCSS styles

## SCSS Guidelines

-   Try to avoid using `!important` in styles
-   Try to make sure that styles are scoped to the component using the `:host` selector
-   Try to follow accessibility best practices
-   Use CSS variables for colors
-   Always reference `src\assets\styles\style.scss` for global classes and styles
-   Try to make sure that styles are scoped to the component using the `:host` selector
-   Always prefer `px` over `rem` for font sizes and spacing
